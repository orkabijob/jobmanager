# Orkabi — Session Handoff & Status

_Last updated: 2026-06-24. Hand this to the next session/team to continue._

Orkabi (Hebrew: **עורקבי**) is a role-based, 100%-Hebrew RTL web app for an educational crafting business — managing operations, logistics, instructor shifts, and curriculum. Built as a **modular monolith** in ASP.NET Core 8, in **vertical slices**.

---

## ✅ Status: PROJECT FEATURE-COMPLETE — all 5 slices (0–5) are COMPLETE, deployed, and LIVE.

- **Live:** https://orkabi.onrender.com (login works; admin lands on `/Dashboard/Admin`; CS/Admin manage People at `/People`, Curriculum at `/Curriculum`, Scheduling at `/Scheduling`, Operations at `/Operations`, Logistics at `/Logistics/Orders` + packing list at `/Logistics/PackingList`; the **Action Hub** is at `/Operations/ActionItems` for all roles; instructors take attendance from `/Dashboard/Instructor`)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/orkabijob/jobmanager (branch `master`; Slice-5 merge `f91e94c`)
- **Tests:** 251/251 green (`dotnet test`). Build clean.
- **Slice 5 deploy verified:** anonymous `/Logistics/PackingList` + `/Operations/ActionItems` → 302 → login, `/health` → ok. Boot `MigrateAsync` applied `AddActionItemResolvedFields` on real Neon.
- **Slice 5 delivers:** the Action_Item **resolve flow** (`ResolveActionItemAsync` nulls the dedup key so recurrences re-fire), the role-aware **polling Action Hub** (resolve + 25s refresh), a **`DashboardMetricsService`** with **real Admin bento + CS/Logistics dashboards** (placeholders gone) + dynamic greeting, the Logistics **master packing list** (print-friendly), syllabus→class assignment, and polish (save-success toasts via an ASCII-safe `HX-Trigger`, a `_PageShell` partial for new pages, a CSS-completeness sweep).
- **Slice 4 delivers:** Logistics_Order + the **dispute loop** (`SupplyPacingService`: seed → Packed → Accepted/Disputed; Disputed → urgent Admin Action_Item) + Logistics pages; the in-process **`DailyJobScheduler` BackgroundService** (5-min PeriodicTimer Asia/Jerusalem, **catch-up-on-wake**, scope-per-run, Testing-gated, drains the outbox each tick) running **birthday + shift-gen** daily jobs via a timer-free `IDailyJobRunner`, with **`JobExecutionLog`** (unique `(JobName,ScheduledFor)`) exactly-once; **event-driven automations** — double-consecutive-absence + deferred tryout-followup (same-tx OutboxEvents + new drainer branches) and **mass-dropout** (`ClientService.DeactivateAsync`, wired from the Clients/Edit deactivation path); and **6 new dedup-keyed Action_Item creators**.
- **Slice 3 delivers:** Operations (Extra-Hours / Incident / Vacation, single-approval) + the **Outbox + Action-Item kernel** + the **Real-Gap monitor** (Lesson_Log save → same-transaction OutboxEvent → drain → Admin Action_Item, dedup-keyed) + a minimal Admin Action-Items read page.

### Post-roadmap backlog hardening (in progress — since 2026-06-27)
After the 5-slice roadmap shipped, work continues against `docs/orkabi-backlog.md` (the authoritative checklist). Done so far:
- **B1 — `/Admin/Users`** — user & role management (create user, assign/revoke roles, enable/disable via Identity lockout, reset password; Admin-only; last-admin guard).
- **Help center — `/Help`** — roles + user-management explainer + per-area cards + FAQ, linked from every dashboard, the shared `_PageShell`, and AccessDenied.
- **B2 — `/Scheduling/Substitutions/Create`** `[InstructorOrAdmin]` — instructors create a pending substitution request for one of their *own future* shifts (handler enforces ownership / future-only / valid-different-instructor / no-duplicate-pending; the service's `RequestSubstitutionAsync` is a thin write with no authz) and cancel their own pending requests; reachable via a "בקש החלפה" link on the instructor dashboard. This makes the Admin approval queue at `/Scheduling/Substitutions` actually reachable — previously no UI ever created requests.
- **B3 — `/Admin/AcademicYears`** `[Authorize(Roles=Admin)]` — list / create / set-current for academic years (the Sept-2026 rollover surface; the birthday job keys off the current year). Create makes a non-current year (handler rejects end ≤ start, dates are `DateOnly?` so the Hebrew Required messages fire); set-current uses the existing transactional clear-before-set, honoring the single-current partial index. Added `AcademicYearService.CreateAsync`; reachable via a "שנות לימוד" link on the Admin dashboard.
- **F1 — Extra-hours deny** — `OperationsService.DenyExtraHoursAsync` + `OnPostDenyAsync` (Admin-only) + a "דחייה" button / "נדחה" chip, mirroring the Vacations approve/deny. Added the `ExtraHoursStatus.Denied` enum value (int-mapped — **no migration**). Also fixed a latent binary status render in the instructor's own-submissions list that the new value exposed. No denial-reason column added (would need a migration).
- **F5–F9 — Operations/Scheduling authz + nav hardening** — Logistics excluded from the Operations hub + Incidents (new `AppRoles.CsOrInstructorOrAdmin`; CS still *reads* incidents); a shared role-gated `_OperationsSubnav` partial replaces 5 drifted inline copies (and fixes F8: ActionItems link for all roles, Logistics sees only that); Scheduling "החלפות" gated to Admin across all 6 Scheduling pages + the hub card; the Incidents submit form is instructor-only in **both** view and handler (`Forbid` guard); Admin can now open `/Dashboard/Logistics` (`LogisticsOrAdmin`). _Latent follow-up: `PageShellVm.SubnavFor(Operations/Scheduling)` needs the same role allow-lists before the TD13 `_PageShell` migration._
- **F3 + F4 — Logistics dispute loop** — `SupplyPacingService.RepackDisputedAsync` (Disputed→Pending, clears notes, resolves the dispute ticket) + a "החזר לאריזה" re-pack button/handler; dispute tickets now `AssignedToRole = Logistics` (visible in the Logistics dashboard + Action Hub; Admin still sees all via `ListAllOpenAsync`, the by-type count, and the alerts feed — disputes intentionally leave the Admin's *personal* focal-tile queue). No migration.
- **F2 — Incident lifecycle (both)** — (A) High-severity incidents append an `IncidentSevere` outbox event → drainer → Admin action item (`EnsureSevereIncidentActionItemAsync`); (B) an `IncidentStatus` (Open/Closed/Escalated) lifecycle with Admin close/escalate handlers + status chips; closing an incident resolves its severe ticket. `OperationsService` gained an `ActionItemService` dependency. **⚠️ DB MIGRATION `AddIncidentReportStatus`** (one non-null int column, default Open) — applied by `MigrateAsync` at boot on the next `master` deploy; verify on Neon.
- **F11 — Instructor cancels own pending vacation** — `CancelVacationAsync` (ownership + Pending → `Cancelled`) + a "ביטול" button; added `VacationStatus.Cancelled` (no migration) with its "בוטל" render. No migration.
- **F19 — Instructor dashboard quick-links** — a "פעולות מהירות" card-grid (sub-request, extra-hours, vacations, incident, my-orders, action-items) so the instructor's operations aren't URL-only.
- **F20 — "First incomplete model" resolver** — `SchedulingService.ResolveCurrentModelForClassAsync` (first syllabus model whose Completed-lesson count is below its expected) now drives both the attendance lesson-log resolution and the dashboard "דגם:" chip — progression was frozen at model #1 before. No migration.

**Tests: 350/350 green** (`dotnet test`). Work is on feature branches; **nothing merged to `master`** (production deploy gate — requires explicit sign-off). **One pending migration awaits that deploy: `AddIncidentReportStatus`.**

### What Slice 0 delivers
- **Auth:** ASP.NET Core Identity (int keys), email/password + Google OAuth plumbing (Google not yet configured → button auto-hides). Cookie auth (HttpOnly, env-branched Secure, `/api/*`→401). Password policy 8+ chars, no complexity. OAuth `email_verified` gate.
- **RBAC:** 4 fixed roles (Admin / CustomerService / Logistics / Instructor); role-router home (`/`) + 4 role-gated dashboards.
- **Cross-cutting foundations:** `IArchivable` + global-query-filter pattern, `BaseEntity` + audit interceptor (sync+async), dual-provider data (SQLite `EnsureCreated` for tests / **Npgsql migrations for prod**), `IsraelClock` (Asia/Jerusalem) constant.
- **Design:** Apple **Liquid Glass** RTL system — photo backdrop (`wwwroot/img/bg-liquid.jpg`) the glass refracts, recessed-well inputs, text-immune `.glass__lens` layer, `he-IL` culture, self-hosted Assistant + Heebo fonts. Admin **bento** dashboard (⚠️ still **placeholder** data).
- **Ops:** `/health`, the `/api/*` 401 seam, Dockerfile, `render.yaml`, env-var admin seed, `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

### What Slice 1 (People) delivers
- **Entities (`Modules/People/`):** `AcademicYear` (lookup; single-current enforced by partial unique index; seeded **תשפ"ו / 5786**, 2025-09-01→2026-06-30), `School`, `Class` (the **only** archival aggregate — `EntityStatus` + global query filter; partial unique index on school+year+name WHERE Active), `Client` (uses `IsActive`, orthogonal to archival — dropouts stay visible), `Enrollment` join (`EnrollmentStatus` Active/Tryout/Dropped/Completed; `IsTryout`/`PaidMaterials`/`PaidMonthly`; partial unique index on (client,class) WHERE not Dropped → re-enroll after drop allowed). All FKs `Restrict`. `Class.SyllabusId` deliberately deferred to Slice 2.
- **Service layer:** `AcademicYearService` (incl. transactional `SetCurrentAsync`), `SchoolService`, `ClassService` (archived view via `IgnoreQueryFilters`), `ClientService` (active-only vs all), `EnrollmentService` (app-level dup guard + DB safety-net index, drop, tryout/payment toggle).
- **Pages (`Pages/People/`, all `[Authorize(Roles = AppRoles.CsOrAdmin)]`):** People hub, Schools CRUD, Classes CRUD (+ archived filter), Clients CRUD (+ active filter), and the **signature Roster builder** (`/People/Classes/Roster/{id}`) — two-pane enroll/drop, three per-enrollment toggle pills (חומרים/חודשי/ניסיון), tryout tray + TRYOUT badge, friendly Hebrew duplicate-enroll error.
- **Design:** new People component vocabulary in `base.css` (subnav, page-head, data-table, recessed-well forms, segmented control, toggle pill, status chips, empty states, roster two-pane, tryout tray) — all from `docs/design/slice-1-people-design.md`.
- **Cleanup:** removed the `Probe` scaffold + all Bootstrap/jQuery/`site.css`/`_ValidationScriptsPartial`/`_Layout.cshtml.css` template cruft; fixed the `GoogleSchemeTests` file-lock flake.

## Live infrastructure (where things run)

| Piece | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Host** | Render (free, Docker, **auto-deploys on push to `master`**). Free tier sleeps after ~15 min → ~30–60s cold start; if a boot migration ever fails its health check, Render keeps the previous deploy serving (no outage). |
| **DB** | Neon (free) — project `orkabi` (`cold-math-14190037`), org `org-wild-hall-90364045`, db `neondb`. Both `ConnectionStrings__Default` and `__Migrations` use the **direct** (non-pooled) endpoint. |
| **Secrets** | All live secrets are **Render env vars**: the two `ConnectionStrings__*`, `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and (when wired) `Authentication__Google__ClientId`/`Secret`. Not in the repo. |
| **Admin login** | Seeded admin = `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Idempotent on boot. |
| **Migrations** | Applied at boot via `MigrateAsync` (idempotent). To apply manually: `ORKABI_MIGRATIONS_CONNSTRING="<direct neon string>" dotnet ef database update --project src/Orkabi.Web`. |

## 🚧 Roadmap (vertical slices, build in order)

See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-orkabi-roadmap.md`.

- **Slice 0 — Walking skeleton.** ✅ LIVE
- **Slice 1 — People.** ✅ LIVE
- **Slice 2 — Curriculum + Scheduling.** ✅ LIVE. Models, Syllabus (+ ordered Syllabus_Models), `Class.SyllabusId` FK, Shift_Template→Instance with `ShiftInstanceGenerator`, `Substitution_Request` + **date-scoped resource authorization** (service guard `CanAccessShiftAsync`), `Lesson_Log` (+ `expected_lessons_snapshot`), Attendance via optimistic `/api/attendance` (idempotency key) + lesson-log HTMX pacing; HTMX self-hosted + antiforgery-wired in `_Layout`; the signature instructor attendance surface (Blue-Jay monolith + tap-to-mark). `TimeOnly` shift times stored as `text` (EF9-SQLite value-converter parity — tech-debt only if time-range SQL is needed later).
- **Slice 3 — Operations + Real-Gap.** ✅ LIVE. Extra_Hours, Incident_Report, Vacation_Request (single-approval), the **Outbox + Action_Item kernel**, and the Real-Gap pacing monitor.
- **Slice 4 — Logistics + Automations.** ✅ LIVE. Logistics_Order + dispute loop, `SupplyPacingService`, the in-process **`DailyJobScheduler` BackgroundService with catch-up-on-wake** + `JobExecutionLog` (birthdays, shift-gen), event-driven double-absence + mass-drop-out, deferred tryout follow-up, 6 dedup-keyed Action_Item creators.
- **Slice 5 — Action Hub + real dashboards.** ✅ LIVE. `Action_Item` resolve flow (clears dedup key) + role-aware polling Action Hub; real Admin bento + CS/Logistics dashboards (placeholders gone); Logistics master packing list; syllabus→class assignment; carryover polish (`_PageShell` for new pages, save-success toasts, dynamic greeting).

**🎉 The roadmap is complete — Orkabi is feature-complete and fully live.**

## ⚠️ Known issues / tech debt (deferred, non-blocking)

- ~~Admin dashboard data is placeholder~~ — **DONE in Slice 5** (real `DashboardMetricsService` metrics).
- **Deferred from Slice 5 (non-blocking, for a future pass):**
  - **`_PageShell` migration:** the 20 existing Slice-0..4 pages still inline their topbar+subnav (the shared `_PageShell` partial is used only by new Slice-5 pages — extracting the rest was deferred to avoid risk).
  - **Real-time Action Hub:** currently polling (25s); SignalR push is a later phase per spec §3.
  - **Multi-role hub scoping:** a user holding two *non-Admin* roles (e.g. CS+Logistics) sees only the first role's hub items (not a leak — resolve authz re-checks `IsInRole`; a completeness gap).
  - **Latent date-window mismatch (observed, not a live bug):** `ShiftInstanceGenerator` uses Israel-date while the Scheduling Instances page filters by UTC-date — cannot drop a row in practice; worth aligning later.
  - Minor test-quality items (some indirect assertions; a naive-UTC month boundary in one *test* while the service is Israel-TZ-correct).
- **Hebrew Identity errors:** Identity validation messages render in English — add a Hebrew `IdentityErrorDescriber`.
- **Open self-registration:** anyone can hit `/Account/Register` (gets no role → AccessDenied). Decide if it should be admin-only.
- **Google OAuth not wired:** create a Google OAuth client, set `Authentication__Google__ClientId`/`Secret` in Render, add redirect URI `https://orkabi.onrender.com/signin-google`. Button then appears automatically.
- **Slice-1 polish (deferred to Slice 2):** People topbar greeting is static "שלום" (no user name) and the topbar/subnav shell is repeated per page (extract a shared `_PeopleShell`/layout partial); no save-success toasts. Minor test-coverage gaps (Class-name partial-index enforcement test; AuditInterceptor update-path test).
- **Free-tier sleep:** ~30–60s cold start after idle. Optional later: UptimeRobot `/health` ping or a ~$5 always-on host.
- Minor: `RoleRoutingTests` uses an exact-string `Location` compare (prefer `LocalPath`).

## How this project is built (process + conventions)

- **Subagent-driven development:** per task → fresh implementer subagent → task-review gate (spec + quality) → fix; a final whole-branch review (strongest model) before merge; deploy + verify. Tests are xUnit; SQLite `EnsureCreated` for the fast inner loop, Npgsql/Neon for prod (the real-Neon deploy is the Postgres-fidelity gate). Progress ledger at `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` (gitignored).
- **Commands:** `dotnet test`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`. New migration: `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/Orkabi.Web` (offline; design-time factory uses a fake Npgsql string).
- **Branch/deploy:** each slice on its own branch (`slice-N-...`); merge to `master` only when complete + reviewed + green → Render auto-deploys → verify `/health` + a slice route. **Pushing to `master` triggers a production deploy and requires explicit user sign-off** (harness-gated).
- **User working preferences (important):** FULL autonomous mandate through ALL slices — do not pause between slices; route every question/decision to a **specialist agent** (Architect / Full-stack / Reviewer / Apple Liquid-Glass designer / researcher), never to the user. The user oversees at PM altitude. The only confirmed exception: the production deploy push to `master`.

## Suggested next moves
1. Finish **Slice 2 (Curriculum + Scheduling)** via the subagent-driven process (architect + designer blueprints already in flight; write the just-in-time plan, execute task-by-task, deploy + verify).
2. Optionally wire Google OAuth (needs creds from the user).
